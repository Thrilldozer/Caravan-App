		<h1>About Transit Network</h1>
		<h4>Transit Network is a platform that democratizes the flow of information about issues that riders encounter on public
		transit.<br /><br  />
		Utilizing the data provided by major transit systems for modern-day navigation tools (namely, GTFS),
		Transit Network allows for developers to easily extend open data for schedules and routes in their city, creating a channel
		for productive expression of transit issues. We hope to empower transit riders to take better advantage of transportatation
		resources, and push for positive changes in their transit systems.</h4>
